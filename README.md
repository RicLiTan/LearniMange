LearniMange is a program to help you keep on track with any tasks or events you have. 
You will be able to keep track of events, occurances that have happen at a point in time.
You will also be able to track tasks, occurances which you have to complete an action a certain amount of times.
Leave the mental load of remembering when these things occur to increase your productivity and free time while reducing stress.

This is a MAUI application. To begin using, navigate to the add task page and add a task you would like to keep track of. 
The program will ask you for numbers to represent the date and time you would like to set.
The displays will update as you add more tasks.
Be sure to keep on top of things!
